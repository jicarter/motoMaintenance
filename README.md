# `Moto-Maintenance`

This project was designed to simplify tracking maintenance for several motorcycles/vehicles. It allows the user to add their vehicles of choice and then add scheduled maintenance events for each. It allows them to view each vehicle and it's corresponding completed and to-do maintenance events. Moto-Maintenance makes it easy to keep up with routine maintenance and even bigger tasks by providing outside resources to help complete the job. From ordering parts to watching YouTube videos to help you along, Moto-Maintenance provides all the necessary components to help take care of your vehicles. 

## `Get Started`

When the user registers they are taken to the home page which provides a simple explanation of the site and quick navigation tips.

### `Adding Vehicles`

Once the user has navigated to the Vehicles page they are given the option to add a new vehicle by clicking the add vehicle button. Once the button is clicked the user is presented a form where they are able to fill out the necessary information to add their vehicle. They are even given the opportunity to add vehicle specific notes to help them remember important points. 

After the user finishes the form and saves the vehicle they are taken to the vehicle details page wehre they can view their vehicle information. From there they can edit or delete the vehicle. They can even add a maintenance event for that vehicle from the same page. 

### `Adding Maintenance`

If the user uses the add maintenance button from the vehicle details they will be presented a form to fill out for that vehicle and it's new maintenance event. Once that event has been saved it will return the user to the vehicle details page wehre they can view the vehicle as well as the new maintenance event. The user is able to edit the event, delete the event, and even set the event as complete. After the event is set to complete it is shown in the vehicle details as completed.

Once the add maintenance button has been clicked they will be presented with a form to add maintenance with a dropdown to select the vehicle they wish to add the event to.

### `Resources`

The navigation bar at the top of the page offers some resources that will help the user complete any maintenance tasks. The links open a new tab that allows the user to remain on Moto-Maintenance while accessing the resources. There is a link to order parts, a link to provide how-to videos, a link to a vehicle database, and a link to vehicle maintenance manuals. 

The navBar also includes a link to view the current users profile. Here the user has the option to change the URL for one of the outside source links to their desired URL of choice.
